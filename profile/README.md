# Quantum Machine Learning research group

On the one hand, our group utilizes machine learning techniques to support the development of the layers mentioned (i.e., machine learning for quantum). On the other hand, the group uses the results and benefits of all layers to provide solutions to domain experts (i.e., quantum machine learning).
